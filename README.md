## Prerequisites (needs updating)
- vnc
- cross compiler: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

## Current Features
- Basic terminal support
- Keyboard inputs
- Paging
- Heap management (malloc/free)

## Coming soon
- Enhanced graphics with framebuffer and UI
- Multiprocessing

## Debug
Run QEMU and listen for GDB connections via `./gdb.sh`. Then, in another terminal instance, execute `./debug.sh`. This opens gdb and connects to localhost:1234, as well as loads the symbol file generated by gdb.sh. Set break points with `break` before running the OS via `continue` (it automatically stops at the start).

NOTE: This is all for a VNC setup, so if you're using VNC, make sure to boot into the OS on VNC after you enter `continue` in gdb, to get the OS running, for real.
