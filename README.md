## Prerequisites
- vnc
- cross compiler: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

## Todo
- [x] Add support for newlines to terminal driver
- [x] Implement terminal scrolling
- [x] Reorganise into a proper OS skeleton
- [x] Implement standard library stuff
- [x] Implement GDT
- [ ] Implement IDT and keyboard interrupts

## Debug
Run QEMU and listen for GDB connections via `./gdb.sh`. Then, in another terminal instance, execute `./debug.sh`. This opens gdb and connects to localhost:1234, as well as loads the symbol file generated by gdb.sh. Set break points with `break` before running the OS via `continue` (it automatically stops at the start).

NOTE: This is all for a VNC setup, so if you're using VNC, make sure to boot into the OS on VNC after you enter `continue` in gdb, to get the OS running, for real.
